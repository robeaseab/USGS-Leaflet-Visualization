# Visualizing Data with Leaflet



For this project I crated an interactive map using United States Geological Survey (USGS) scientific earthquake data. USGS collects a massive amount of data from all over the world each day. The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes.  The goal of this project is visualize their data in a meaningful and accessable way.

    Data Source:  [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) 

 Features of this project: 

   * Map created using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.

   * Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * A legend that provides context for my map data.
